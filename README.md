# Low-Latency Issues

### Guide to Fixing Fast Flag-Related Issues:

## 1 Roblox Not Launching?:  
#### Potential Problematic Flags:  
```json
{
    "FIntRuntimeMaxNumOfConditions": "1000000",
    "FIntRuntimeMaxNumOfSchedulers": "1000000",
    "FIntRuntimeMaxNumOfSemaphores": "1000000",
    "FIntRuntimeMaxNumOfLatches": "1000000",
    "FIntRuntimeMaxNumOfMutexes": "1000000",
    "FIntRuntimeMaxNumOfThreads": "1000000"
}
```
## Reduce the flag's value by removing one zero at a time.  
- For example, if the value was `1000000`, try `100000` and keep decreasing until Roblox starts working.  
The default value is `2400`.

## 2 Lagging Animations?:  
#### Potential Problematic Flag:  
```json
{
    "FIntInterpolationMaxDelayMSec": "100"
}
```
- ##  If you're still experiencing issues, try increasing the value by `15-25` units and test again.  
- ##  If the problem persists, repeat the process by incrementing the value by `15-25` units each time until the issue is resolved.
- Example:
```json
{
    "FIntInterpolationMaxDelayMSec": "125"
}
```
